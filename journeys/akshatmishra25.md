# [Akshat Mishra](https://github.com/akshatmishra25)'s Journey

## ☞ Intro
Hello folks!
This is Akshat Mishra here currently pursuing a Bachelor in Technology in CSE from Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur.
I have just entered my second year and my coding journey has been quite a rollercoaster ride.
## ☞ The Start!

So, I started my journey like everybody, i.e. being confused what to do or not. With so many programming languages, various tech stacks, development fields, competitive programming websites and what not out there you always end up with a question where to start with. Also, everybody out there on the Internet just says one thing to freshers, EXPLORE!!

## ☞ Exploration!
Thus, my exploring phase began with getting command on C programming language. Tried to learn a bit of Python, C++, Kotlin and also wet my hands with some Android App Development. I already knew a bit of Java thanks to the ISC Curriculum.
Then you are suddenly told to stop everything and focus on one field of development only along with programmer's biggest pet peeve, DSA!

## ☞ Currently Learning!
So I started going on with the trend of learning DSA with C++ along with Competitive coding on sites like CodeChef, Codeforces,etc and stuck with Web Development.
Currently my goal is to master problem solving using Data, Structures and Algorithms and to create a kind of cool as well as useful Web Applications to show my skills.

## ☞ Challenges!
One key thing I have in this small journey is that, "Consistency is the Key", as if you stop coding for a little while you are to bound to forget everything on the way.
So, this is Akshat Mishra signing off with some sort of motivation for everybody through the words of Robert Frost.
"And miles to go before I sleep"
