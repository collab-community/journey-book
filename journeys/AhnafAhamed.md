# My Journey

Growing up in the 21st century I saw how fast the world changed. From touchscreen devices to Augmented Reality. I wasn't that kid who was interested in technology. At high school I choose IT as a subject and that's when my life changed. I found an interest I never had.

At school, I had the chance to participate in an island-wide web development competition which was organized by a neighboring school. I was new to HTML and CSS at that time. Out of courage, I opted in. The challenge was to build a personal website using HTML and CSS. After googling for a few days I discovered Brad Traversy's youtube channel, that's where I learned how to put things together. I built my first working website and won 3rd place, which I am still feel proud of.

Then I started my self learning journey in web development. After a year I landed my first job. This year I'm participating in my first ever hacktoberfest and I'm really proud of myself for becoming the person who I am.
