## About Me! :woman:
I'm currently a computer software developer student in Edmonton, Alberta!

## My Journey (so far :smiley:)
I enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in 2018, aimlessly wandering and figuring out what direction to take my career. I had an open spot in my schedule, but I wasn't sure what to take. I thought I'd decide by looking through all the classes I would generally ignore. 

On that list, I browsed through courses involving literature, forensic sciences, anthropology, theatre production, and then finally, Computer Sciences. I was always intrigued by technology and its complicated processes but was always scared of going anywhere near it. I decided to enroll to see what happens behind what always felt like closed doors and figured I would withdraw before the drop deadline to get my tuition back before the deadline. 

After the first two weeks, I realized it was the only class I was genuinely excited to attend (even though it was an 8 AM class!) and decided to not drop it. 

However, even though I was liking it, there were countless times that I kept believing I wasn't meant for it or good enough. I ended up dropping courses out of discouragement and went on a path toward the medical field. However, there was always a part of my brain that wouldn't let go of programming.

I felt like a robot studying medical terminology and life science. I studied to get good grades but wasn't passionate about it. I decided to take a leap of faith, drop out of my current studies again, and give computer sciences another try. Four years later, I can confidently say it was one of the best choices I've ever made. 

## What mistakes have you made?
:point_right: Believing that struggling means programming isn't for you. There's always something new to learn because it's a constantly growing field.  
:point_right: Having a negative mindset about my abilities  
:point_right: Not accepting that struggling is a normal part of the process

## What advice would you give to your 18 year old younger self?
:purple_heart: Embrace every error message you get, those red messages are friendly! They're like a little friend trying to guide you towards the solution  
:green_heart: Push through the discomfort of not knowing something.   
:blue_heart: Learn at your own pace - Any success, no matter how small, is something to celebrate!    
:heart: Reaching out for help is not something to be ashamed about. Connect with your peers and your instructors!  
:yellow_heart: Don't compare yourself to others and how quickly they might understand something you don't understand yet (because you'll get there!)  
:heartpulse: Most importantly, don't ever doubt yourself and what you're capable of!
