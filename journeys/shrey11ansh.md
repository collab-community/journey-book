# [Shreyansh Chaubey](https://github.com/shrey11ansh)'s Journey

## ☞ Introduction
Hey folks!
This is Shreyansh Chaubey currently pursuing a Bachelor in Technology in CSE from Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur.
I am in my 3rd semester and 2 semster back only I have started my coding quest.
## ☞ The Beginning

So, I started my journey like everybody, i.e. being confused what to do. With so many programming languages, various tech stacks, development fields, competitive programming websites and what not out there you always end up with a question where to start with. After consulting some seniors and exploring channels on youtube I decided to go with the flow of the coding culture of my college i.e, "Its 1st sem. only u can still ENJOY."

## ☞ Struggle is real
Thus, my exploring phase began with getting command on C programming language. Tried to learn a bit of Python, C++.
Then you are suddenly told to stop everything and focus on one field of development only along with programmer's biggest pet peeve, DSA!

## ☞ Consistent on
So I started going on with the trend of learning DSA with C++ along with Competitive coding on sites like CodeChef, Codeforces,etc and stuck with Web Development.
Currently my goal is to master problem solving using Data, Structures and Algorithms and to create a kind of cool as well as useful Web Applications to show my skills.

## ☞ Challenges are Opportunity
One key thing I have learnt in this small journey is that, "Slow and Steady Wins the Race", as if you stop coding for a little while you are to bound to forget everything on the way.
So, this is Shreyansh Chaubey signing off with some sort of motivation for everybody through the words of Shahrukh Khan
"JAB TUM KISI CHEEZ KO DIL SE CHAHO TO PURI KAYANAT USEY TUMSE MILANE KI KOSHISH ME LAG JATI HAI"
