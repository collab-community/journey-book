## How I Began Coding!
I started coding in 2020. It was lockdown and it was boring to play games all day so I decided to learn to code. The first language that I learnt to code was either Python or C#, I'm unsure as of this point. 
### Shourgamer2's Journey
I was intrested in making games so I learnt the [unity engine](https://unity.com) and started using it. I used to code all day at that time and I was working on a project called the "Golden pistol"
Which was a fps story game. Sadly after I exported the game I didn't publish it. Well then I got interest in [Roblox games](https://roblox.com/groups/11702007/shour-games) (which I have tried before but at that time I thought it will be a waste of time to make games in Roblox)
So I built Roblox games and I watched some YouTube videos to learn Lua.
### What I have done so far! 
I have built a lot of projects like [TermBolt - A terminal ](https://github.com/shourgamer2/termbolt), [What-Language -A programming language (In work, uses the terminal for most of the operation. Like a toy language for now)](https://github.com/what-language).
And more on https://shourgamer2.tk/#projects and I also own the team [ShourGames](https://github.com/shourgames).
