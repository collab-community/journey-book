# [Shourjjo Majumder](https://github.com/shourgamer2)'s Coding Journey

## How I Began Coding!

I started coding in 2020. It was lockdown and it was boring to play games all day, so I decided to learn to code. The first language that I learned to code was either Python or C#. I'm unsure as of this point.

### Shourgamer2's Journey

I was interested in making games, so I learned the [unity engine](https://unity.com) and started using it. I used to code all day at that time and I was working on a project called the "Golden pistol"
Which was a fps story game. Sadly, after I exported the game I didn't publish it. Well, then I got interested in Roblox games (which I have tried before, but at that time I thought it would be a waste of time to make games in Roblox)
So I built [Roblox games](https://roblox.com/groups/11702007/shour-games) and I watched some YouTube videos to learn *Lua*.

### What I have done so far!

I have built a lot of projects like [TermBolt - A terminal ](https://github.com/shourgamer2/termbolt), [What-Language -A programming language (In work, uses the terminal for most of the operation. Like a toy language for now)](https://github.com/what-language).
And more on https://shourgamer2.tk/#Projects and I also own the team [ShourGames](https://github.com/shourgames).
