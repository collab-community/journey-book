# [Kendall Pinto](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding)'s Coding Journey

I am Kendall, from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I mostly code Web-Dev (HTML, CSS, a little JS) and used to code Python in between. I started doing coding around 2019; it was, I believe. I still to this day try to code pretty often, and really like coding.. I do it as a hobby and for timepass. I try to be up to date with the new technologies as they come out.

## My Journey

- There have been some times where I've been pretty frustrated and there have been some times which I've been really impressed at my self.. Coding gives you this feeling that you accomplished something, if you get what I mean, once you start creating projects.

## Dificulties Faced

I've faced a lot of problems with my projects and for some projects it took me a long time to fix those problems. But I kept calm and knew that once the problem was fixed, I would accomplish something.

## How I started Open Source

I was fascinated with open-source and decided that I should contribute to a few interesting projects and hence got into open-source.
