# [Kendall Pinto](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding)'s Coding Journey

- I started doing coding around 2019, it was I believe. I still to this day try to code pretty often, and really like coding.. I do it as a hobby, timepass.

## My Journey

- There have been some times where I've been pretty frustrated and there have been some times which I've been really impressed at my self.. Coding gives you this feeling that you acomplished something, if you get what I mean, once you start creating projects.

## Dificulties Faced

I've faced a lot of problems with my projects and for some projects it took me a long time to fix those problems, but I kept calm and knew that once the problem is fixed, I would acomplish something.

## How did I start Open Source

I was facinated with open-source and decided that I should contribute to a few interesting projects and hence got into open-source.
