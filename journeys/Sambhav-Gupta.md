# [Sambhav Gupta](https://github.com/sambhavgupta0705)'s Journey

My coding journey started in 2017 when I learned Java in my High School and from that time 
I developed a keen interest in coding.

## My Journey
In 2017, I started my coding journey, developed a keen interest in it for 2 years. After that, I started preparing for competitive exams so I wasn't able to do much coding in that period.
After completion of exams, I came back to coding and started learning C++ in 2021.

After that I tried exploring Web Development and find frontend development a quite interesting.

Currently I am trying my hands on backend development and Open Source contribution.
