# Manish's Journey

## ☞ The Start!

All this started with Youtube...
One day I randomly came across this guy named Kunal Kuhswaha in a podcast with Ishan Sharma and from there I developed an interest in not just gsoc but also in this whole open source thing. Then I started following Kunal Kushwaha and from there my coding journey started from learning Java and getting exposed to a very amazing field of DevOps and open source.

Though by that time I already had my interest set on Android dev and I got started with my Android journey from learning kotlin to making some decent projects on Android. And during this time when I was learning Android dev, I made a huge mistake of not exploring other fields like web dev, DevOps, and open source despite not having so much fun with Android dev. It was just a matter of time before I realized this mistake of mine and soon after that I reconsidered everything I was doing and decided to explore web-dev and DevOps and also got started with open source contribution, and this realization was just 1.5 months ago from today, that is 5/10/2022. So yeah, now I'm doing web dev and yeah, it sure is fun.


## ☞ Currently Learning

Currently, I am focussed on:
<li> Front End Web development </li>
<li> Makinig projects on whatever tech I'm learning, at present it is HTML+CSS. </li>
<li> Contributing to open source </li>
<li> Getting involved in open source communities</li>


## ☞ Interests

- I want to learn full-stack Web Development, and then want to explore DevOps field. 
- Also there is open source programs like gsoc, mlh, github campus expert that interests me a lot, so working to achieve them.
