# [Agrim Sharma](https://github.com/Agrim-Sharma174)'s Journey

## ☞ The Start!

All this started with Twitter...
I was more active on the Space & Astronomy side of Twitter, until one day, when I was introduced to Tech Twitter by my twin brother and started following the tweets and was fascinated by the vastness and interesting stuff in the field. I started understanding various new words and terms people used to tweet.
So, I started learning Web Development... did it till CSS, and built few small projects.

## ☞ Challenges

The main challenge which I felt, is consistency...
For me, I had entrance exams at the time I completed CSS, and I had to focus on them. So, I left web development, because of which I forgot all the concepts and stuff. Then, I had to start all over again. This applies to everyone, whenever we stop practicing something we tend to forget it. So, maintain the consistency, always. 

## ☞ Currently Learning

Currently, I am focussed on:
<li> Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ language </li>
<li> JavaScript in Web Development </li>
<li> Making some projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (You will be able to find my projects on my GitHub, mentioned below) </li>

## ☞ Interests

I want to learn full-stack Web Development, and then want to explore Machine Learning field, and want to build some good big projects combining all my learnings.
