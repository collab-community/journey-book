# [Ebuka Chuqz](https://github.com/Ebukachuqz)'s Journey

I am Ebuka, from Nigeria. I am a MERN Stack developer, with biased preference to backend development. 
Asides coding, I love to study psychology, make people laugh, and I am currently trying to make reading a habit.

## My Journey
My journey in coding started in 2017, when a senior developer gave me a bunch of web dev tutorials to learn from.

Things were going well until I lost my laptop and my journey stalled till 2020, when I was stumped on CS50x Introduction to computer programming.

After I finished the course in 2021, I gained skills in web dev and built a CRUD blog with python and Flask.

At the beginning of 2022, I started to learn Javascript, then Node, then react.

## Currently

Currently, I am learning cloud development on Udacity and trying my best to get into Open source, collaborate and make friends from around the world.
