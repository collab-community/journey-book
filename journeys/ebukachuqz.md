# [Ebuka Chuqz](https://github.com/Ebukachuqz)'s Journey

I am Ebuka, from Nigeria. I am a MERN Stack developer. It biased preference to backend development.
Aside's coding, I love to study on psychology, make people laugh and I am currently trying to make reading a habit.

## My Journey
My journey in coding started in 2017, when a senior developer gave me a bunch of web dev tutorials to learn from. 

Things were going well till I lost my laptop and my journey stalled till 2020 when I stumped on CS50x Introduction to computer programming.

After I finished the course in 2021, I had gained skills in web dev and built a CRUD blog with python and Flask.

At the beginning of 2022, I started to learn javascript, then Node, then react.

## Currently

Currently I am learning cloud development on Udacity and trying my possible best to get into Open source, collaborate and make friends from around the world.
