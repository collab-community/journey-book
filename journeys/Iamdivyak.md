# 🚀My Journey

I come from a small town called Siwan in West Bihar, and my dream was to pursue a career in Computer Science by studying B.Tech abroad. However, due to sudden changes in my personal life, I was unable to fulfill that dream. Unfortunately, there were no facilities in my hometown for me to study B.Tech.

Instead, I began searching online for ways to learn more about computers and technology in general, as well as ways to make money from home using my computer. I ended up making some money for a short period of time by working as a Wordpress developer in a local agency in a very less monthly pay, and then became interested in learning more about website development.

Over the past year and a half, I have dedicated myself to learning various tech skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, and I'm currently focusing on mastering Python. I have completed several projects, ranging from simple web applications to complex full-stack applications, which have honed my skills and provided me with hands-on experience.

Pursuing a career in tech has been my passion for a long time, and I'm thrilled to be on this path. I am currently completing my B.Sc in Maths in my hometown, but I'm actively seeking remote internships to gain more practical experience and expand my skill set. I believe that internships are a great way to learn and grow, and I'm eager to find one that aligns with my interests.

In the future, I plan to move to cities like Hyderabad or Bangalore to pursue better opportunities as a full-stack web developer. I believe that these cities have a thriving tech industry, and they offer exciting opportunities for people who are passionate about technology. I'm excited about the future and can't wait to see where this journey takes me☺️!

Happy coding Everyone🎈🎉!!!
