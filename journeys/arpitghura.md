# [Arpit Ghura](https://github.com/arpitghura) : Exploring Tech

I am Arpit, from India. I am a 3rd year undergrad pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering from LNCT, Bhopal (Tier 3)🙂. I am a C++ programmer and I am currently learning Python. I am also working to master MERN Stack as it helps in viewing things happening in realtime.

Other than that,
