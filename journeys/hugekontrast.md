# [Ashish Khare](https://github.com/hugekontrast) is mad. A story.
I can tell that for sure, being me is difficult. However, I'm good at computer science and programming. This is my first time contributing to the open source, because of the slight want for that t-shirt. Ain't it dope?

Started as a [**java developer**üçµ](https://www.java.com/en/), and turned out to be another hopeless romantic for [**python**üêç](https://www.python.org/), even for competitive contests. Ah! Can't turn back now.

Also, I'm a web developer with a goal to master [**javascript**ü§Ø](http://www.jsfuck.com/) . I am a [**jam-stack**](https://jamstack.org/) developer who loves working with [**APIs**](https://swagger.io/).

Tech I know : java, python, javascript, html, css, tailwind css, nodejs and git.
Tools I know : Inkscape, Postman and Figma.

I'm a big time fan of [**F.R.I.E.N.D.S.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778) So, *" I'm not great at advice. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? "*, said Chandler Bing. I've also watched [**Brooklyn 99**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372), [**The Impractical Jokers**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2100976) ( quite a many seasons ), [**Prodigal Son**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10327354) ( my another all time fave ) and the list goes on forever.

I also love video games. I'm currently grinding in valorant. *It's about drive, it's about power  
We stay hungry, we devour* situation.
