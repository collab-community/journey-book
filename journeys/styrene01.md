# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Harsh Waghela](https://github.com/styrene01) : Learning FullStack Web Development

# I am a final year undergrad student from Mumbai.

I have done a 6 month research internship in Deep Learning where I learned how it is used in medical field.

# I'm currently working on

-   Getting to know about Open source
-   Increasing my college GPA
-   Prepping for Exams
-   And applying for internships

# I also like

ðŸ’¡ Formula 1 (Got involved in f1 after watching last years intense battle)

ðŸ’¡ Harry Potter (my favourite character is hagrid)

I would like to advice my 18 year self to not give up easily after facing just little bit difficulties like I did when I started web dev journey in 2019.
