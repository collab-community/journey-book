# [Adarsh Jaiswal](https://github.com/Adarsh-jaiss) : A kid in tech 😎

I am Adarsh, from India 🇮🇳 . I am a Python programmer🐍 and I am currently learning DevOps. I am specially focused on the operator side, but i am trying to be proficient in one programming language, i.e. python , since every operator should have small knowledge about a programming language in devops.

Other than that ,

📌I am an open source advocate 🚩 & 

📌I am a content creator at  TWITTER, and I give talks on various twitter spaces as well.

📌 I am also the founder of @collab-community which has more than 500+ members, and I conduct sessions every week on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PGadh3Vyuv).
