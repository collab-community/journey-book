#  [Manish Pokhrel](https://github.com/manishpoko)'s Journey

## ☞ Introduction
Hi all!
Manish this side. I'm a Second Year ECE student at Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology, New Delhi. I'm new to coding, having done only C as a basic language in my first year.

## ☞ The Buildup
Having no prior knowledge of coding from my school, I was completely blank with computer languages or any programming stuff for that matter! I somehow managed to understand basics of C language as it was barely taught in my 2nd semester. However, now I'm gearing up and learning Java.

## ☞ Current State
Not much here, I had a lot of options to go to as per the language or the stack, but not much guidance. After watching a couple of videos and a bit of research, I decided to go with Java as my primary language (which I'm currently learning). I also want to explore Open Source side by side. DSA too is next on the line!

## ☞ Challenges!
Well, a lot of challenges that seemed insurmountable apparently seem like stepping stones. I did not have any coding exposure, thanks to my school and environment, and neither did I do well in JEE. Also, I had to choose a college that fit my family's financial capabilities, so I had to compromise on the branch too by choosing ECE. All this, but I feel, are mere hurdles in the long run, so I guess I should not scratch my head much on them. Therefore, I'm looking forward to greater opportunities and greener pastures!
