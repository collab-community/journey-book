# [Vikas Ganiga](https://github.com/vikasganiga05)'s Coding Journey

Hi, I am a self-taught Full Stack Developer, Open Source, and Tech Enthusiast from India. I am primarily focused on JavaScript, but my learning style allows me to adapt to new languages and ideologies with ease. I've been building stuff on the web since 2019. I've made countless side projects. I like creating simple and effective UI that optimizes the user experience.

I also love doing open source development and contributions, It gives me a wonderful feeling of achievement and joy which I cannot explain in words. My experience ranges from small personal projects to full production applications capable of scaling and growing through well planned modularity and extensibility.](https://writer.com/grammar-checker/)
