# [Aryav Chaturvedi](https://github.com/aryav-v)'s Journey

The spark of my interest in programming and development was an indirect consequence of HTML classes back in my school days.

Later, I began to explore various Operating Systems including Linux, hopping from one distro to another almost every week. Customizing my operating system helped me learn Lua, a programming language used in various configuration files.

As of today (July 2022), I am exploring various domains including Frontend Development, DevOps and Competitive Programming.
